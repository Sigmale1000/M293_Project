# Responsive Layout with CSS Grid
This project demonstrates a responsive layout for a fictional travel agency called **"Wanderlust Adventures"**. The layout is designed using CSS Grid and has four different breakpoint configurations for various viewport sizes:

Mobile devices smaller than 40em
Tablets starting at 40em
Screens starting at 64em
Large screens starting at 80em
The website features a header, navigation, content, sidebar, and footer sections. The arrangement of these elements changes based on the viewport size, and the navigation orientation switches between horizontal and vertical layouts.
